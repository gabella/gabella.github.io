    <h1>Gravitational Waves, Astrophysics</h1>
    <p>I have researched gravitational waves from potential Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBH) in data 
        from the LIGO detector, from possible emission by exoplanets in the frequency range sensitive by
        the planned space-based detector LISA, and from a compact object orbiting and passing through
        a traversable wormhole.</p>
