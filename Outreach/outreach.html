    <h1>Outreach</h1>
    <p>I have been a research scientist in physics and engineering for my whole career.  This definition of "research scientist" is maybe
        more broad than many may think.  In my case it includes
        doing whatever it takes to get the experiment to run, to believe the data, to make the hardware work, and to 
        stare at the data from a variety of angles with a variety of tools.  I also have been lucky to share my love
        of science with people from ages 14 and up, with outreach efforts to middle school children and with my mentorship
        of the Vanderbilt-QuarkNet Program for high school science teachers, as well as public talks.
