    <h1>Research Interests</h1>
    <p>I have many and varied research and engineering interests.  These include topics in gravitational
        waves, astrophysics, and engineering.</p>

    <h2>
       Gravitational Waves 
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am interested in continuing data analysis for gravitational wave (GW) data.  In the past,
        I have carried out analysis of LIGO data using the RIFT techniques of Richard O'Shaughnessy
        and Jacob Lang, especially looking at possible high mass binary black holes.  At Vanderbilt,
        and in our LIGO group, we were exploring analysis using the Open Science Grid---a shared
        high-throughput computing infrasture making use of idle or designated compute nodes on existing
        clusters. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I would like to have the opportunity to analyze data from pulsar timing array exeperiments---
        though they are not in my experience but I would welcome the opportunity to study these
        experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have some experience looking at novel sources of gravitational waves for the planned, 
        space-based gravitational detector LISA.  With Prof. Kelly Holley-Bockelmann, motivated by
        hot jupiter expolanets, we started to look at GWs from exoplanets.  These did not rise to
        the current estimate of detectability, but close.  And with Emanuele Berti and Kaze Wong
        we wrote a critique of a paper that said you would see expolanets.  
    </p>
    <p>
        For my interests and research in GWs, I have been able to learn and support the numerical
        relativity open access code <a href="https://einsteintoolkit.org"> Einstein Toolkit </a> .
        The current generation of numerical relativity codes are note sensitive enough to take 
        advantage of the likely very nigh signal-to-noise sources that next generation detectors
        will be seeing.  I would like to explore some novel ideas based on nonlinear dynamics 
        techniques and the use of Lie operator methods...possibly along the lines of superconvergent
        perturbation theory.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also wonder if it is possible that Post-Newtonian / Post-Minkowskian expansions might not
        be improved with canonical/sympletic transformations.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is an advanced, if difficult Mathematica toolkit called xAct that is very powerful
        but also very difficult to use.  I would like to explore this tool for many of the calculations
        in GR and wormholes that we come across, e.g. the stability or dynamics of the wormhole
        throat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also as part of my research in GW and my continued interest, with Kelly, Tom Kephart, and
        James Dent, we explored the GWs from a compact object passing back and forth through a 
        traversable wormhole.  Our published paper was the smallest, first step and showing an
        example of a system and its GW waveform---showing that these very speculative and exotic 
        objects could be detectable in the LIGO frequency band.
    </p>
    <p>
        Along those lines, I would be intersted in exploring the behavior of the exotic matter that
        opens the wormhole through in these Visser-like traversable wormholes.  As friends who
        study General Relativity (GR) often say, it is possible to pose what seems an easy question 
        in GR that is very difficult to answer or even address.  I think exploring the motion of
        so-called exotic matter, and its likely fluid behavior as normal matter passes through
        it is very interesting.  The form of the energy-momentum tensor for the exotic matter also
        descides the motion of the throat itself---growing or shrinking or osciallating in radius.
    </p>
    <p>
        Exploring the systems that are purported to have exotic matter like properties would also be
        important.  Is there any kind of imagined or real experiment that might explore the wormhole
        "effect" .
